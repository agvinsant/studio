        <p align="center">Hello, I am Adam Vinsant. I am a freelance graphic designer, web and mobile developer, and virtual office assistant. Pretty much any technical need you have, I can help you with. I got my start as a designer working for a large pre-press company called NEC, Inc. We worked on huge magazine publications all across the nation, including titles such as, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Southern Living</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Popular Mechanics</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Maxim</span>. I got my start working and old Heidelburg drum scanner and started to work my way into the photo editing and page layout divisions. I was trained when Photoshop was still at version 6 as saw the jump to version 7 and the beginnings of the CS series. Unfortunately the company went under due to publishers and printers taking things "in house" eliminating the need for our company. After that, without a college degree, I was unable to find a job so I started doing random freelance work for small businesses, artists, and musicians. After several years of trying my hand at new career opportunities and nothing really filling the void of my graphics and development work, I decided to go to school to finish my education.</p>
        <p align="center">I am currently enrolled in Full Sail University's online Mobile Application Development Bachelors of Science degree program. Not only am I a student, I am a husband and father of two beautiful kids and a part time job as a server for California Pizza Kitchen in Estero, FL. With the economy being what it is today, it's hard to make it out there without multiple streams of income, so here I am. As I progress and excel through school, I continue to learn new things that build to what I have already learned and performed in the past to be able to offer to notch service to my customers.</p>
        <h3 align="center" style="text-decoration:underline">About the site</h3>
        <h4 align="center">UNDER CONSTANT CONSTRUCTION!</h4>
        <h4 align="center">This site is built with mobile devices in mind and is also desktop friendly!</h4>
        <p align="center">This site is built to show you what I can do as far as development and design. It is written in HTML5 using CSS, Javascript, and allot of Jquery Mobile. I have also used a plug in called WOW Slider to produce the image sliders. This is a free app I picked up from the App Store. As my education progresses, then I will continue to add new features to this site.</p>
        <h3 align="center" style="text-decoration:underline">About my mobile mission</h3>
        <p align="center">In this day in age, the need for mobile websites as increased dramatically with just about everyone you see around having a smartphone of some sort. I believe that writing sites today needs to start with a mobile design, so that is how I like to design. Desktop sites still have their place, but need to have a mobile counterpart. So don't just look around at the website and the portfolio images, pay attention to the actual site itself and see how you can have a mobile site that operates as a useable mobile application.</p>
